# Batman History

Batman's origin story features him swearing vengeance against criminals after
witnessing the murder of his parents Thomas and Martha as a child, a vendetta
tempered with the ideal of justice. He trains himself physically and
intellectually, crafts a bat-inspired persona, and monitors the Gotham
streets at night.
